# Congress App

## Project Overview

Congress App is a comprehensive event management solution built on Microsoft PowerPlatform (PowerApps, Power Automate, Dataverse). This application enables event organizers to create events, manage schedules, speakers, and attendees with a streamlined interface and automated workflows.

The solution consists of two complementary applications:
- A back-end management PowerApp for desktop, used by event organizers to set up and administer events
- A front-end mobile PowerApp for event attendees to view schedules, register for sessions, and access event information
